Section 1: Introduction                      *GroffViewerIntroduction*

A vim file type plugin for displaying Groff files in a document 
viewer as determined by the system default or chosen by the user. 
The document viewer used should auto-reload and preferably support 
the postscript file format - examples are Zathura, Evince, Okular 
or Xreader.

====================================================================
Section 2: Usage                                    *GroffViewerUsage*

With a groff file open in the current buffer select:

    `<localleader>o` - Open groff file in selected document viewer
    `<localleader>p` - Hard copy print groff file
    `<localleader>wc` - Displays word and character count

Saving the file in the normal way, e.g. `:w`, will result in the groff 
preview updating in the document viewer, providing the selected 
viewer auto-reloads.

The groff macro used by the plugin is determined by the file 
extension, for example the file `myfile.me` will be processed using 
the `-me` macro package. For further information on groff file 
extensions see man 5 groff_filenames.

The wordcount functionality displays in the statusline a count of 
printed words and characters that will be output by groff, for 
instance the very minimal `-ms` macro document: 
>
  .pp
  hello small-world
<
Will show as `Words: 3, Characters: 15` in the statusline.  As the 
above example shows whitespace and hypens are not included in the 
character count.  Unfortunately the mom macro does not support the 
wordcount functionality, further detail is available at:

Section 2: Configuration                    *GroffViewerConfiguration*

Setting postscript document viewer ~

The system default for opening postscript files according to 
xdg-open will be used as the default document viewer. The default 
xdg-open postscript application can be changed to, for example, 
Zathura by the following Linux terminal command:

`xdg-mime default org.pwmt.zathura.desktop application/postscript`

Alternatively if you do not wish to make a system wide change, then 
the plugin will ignore the xdg-open default if the following line is 
adding to the `.vimrc` / `init.vim`, with the variable as the postscript 
viewer:

`let groffviewer_default="zathura"`

or, for instance:

`let groffviewer_default="okular"`

Setting groff options ~

The command line options available to groff can be added via your 
`vim.rc` / `init.vim` e.g.:

`let groffviewer_options="-dpaper=a4"`

Using a pdf-only document viewer ~

Using a document viewer that supports pdf but not postscript is 
possible by amending the groff options in your `vim.rc` / `init.vim` 
for pdf output. For example should you want to use ePDFView as a 
document viewer:

`let groffviewer_default="epdfview"`
`let groffviewer_options="-T pdf"`

A pdf document viewer that auto-reloads should however still be 
chosen otherwise the document will fail to update on write (ePDFView 
would be a bad choice in this regard).

Setting the printer ~

The `<localleader>p` mapping uses the lp command to hard copy print; 
this assumes a default printer has been set.
