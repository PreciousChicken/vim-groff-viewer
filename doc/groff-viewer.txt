Section 1: Introduction                      *GroffViewerIntroduction*

A vim file type plugin for displaying Groff files in a document 
viewer as determined by the system default or chosen by the user. 
The document viewer used should auto-reload and preferably support 
the postscript file format - examples are Zathura, Evince, Okular 
or Xreader.

====================================================================
Section 2: Usage                                    *GroffViewerUsage*

With a groff file open in the current buffer select:

    `<localleader>o` - Open groff file in selected document viewer
    `<localleader>p` - Hard copy print groff file
    `<localleader>wc` - Displays word and character count

Saving the file in the normal way, e.g. `:w`, will result in the groff 
preview updating in the document viewer, providing the selected 
viewer auto-reloads.

The groff macro used by the plugin is determined by the file 
extension, for example the file `myfile.me` will be processed using 
the `-me` macro package. For further information on groff file 
extensions see man 5 groff_filenames.

Section 2: Configuration                    *GroffViewerConfiguration*

Setting postscript document viewer ~

The system default for opening postscript files according to 
xdg-open will be used as the default document viewer. The default 
xdg-open postscript application can be changed to, for example, 
Zathura by the following Linux terminal command:

`xdg-mime default org.pwmt.zathura.desktop application/postscript`

Alternatively if you do not wish to make a system wide change, then 
the plugin will ignore the xdg-open default if the following line is 
adding to the `.vimrc` / `init.vim`, with the variable as the postscript 
viewer:

`let groffviewer_default="zathura"`

or, for instance:

`let groffviewer_default="okular"`

Setting groff options ~

The command line options available to groff can be added via your 
`vim.rc` / `init.vim` e.g.:

`let groffviewer_options="-dpaper=a4"`

Using a pdf-only document viewer ~

Using a document viewer that supports pdf but not postscript is 
possible by amending the groff options in your `vim.rc` / `init.vim` 
for pdf output. For example should you want to use ePDFView as a 
document viewer:

`let groffviewer_default="epdfview"`
`let groffviewer_options="-T pdf"`

A pdf document viewer that auto-reloads should however still be 
chosen otherwise the document will fail to update on write (ePDFView 
would be a bad choice in this regard).

Setting the printer ~

The `<localleader>p` mapping uses the lp command to hard copy print; this 
assumes a default printer has been set.
